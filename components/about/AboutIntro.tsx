          Every day, ideas are born. Ideas to start a business. Change a

          Codini began with a belief that when people come together around an
          idea, great things can happen. Great is more than the sum of its
          parts: just like a great team is more than a collection of individuals
          and great presentations are more than a collection of slides.
