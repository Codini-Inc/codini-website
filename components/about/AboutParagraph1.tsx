        When we needed Codini, it wasn’t there. So we built it. We rethought
        presentations from the ground up: how we create them, how we use them,
        and how we share them. Codini is answering years of frustrations about
        how hard it is to bring ideas to life, easily and in style.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are a team of eight co-founders who previously built Wunderlist.
        Codini is the modern presentation software we wish we had: designed to
        improve the way presentations are crafted and knowledge is shared.
